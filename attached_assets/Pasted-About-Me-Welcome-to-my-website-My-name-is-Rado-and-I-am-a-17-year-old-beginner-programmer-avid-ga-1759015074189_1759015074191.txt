About Me
Welcome to my website! My name is Rado and I am a 17-year-old beginner programmer, avid gamer, and a tech enthusiast. I have a passion for learning new things and exploring the latest technologies.
As a beginner in programming, I am constantly pushing myself to expand my knowledge and skills. I love to experiment with different programming languages and explore their potential. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to hone my programming skills.
When I'm not programming, you can usually find me immersed in my favorite video games. Gaming has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, and it has helped me develop problem-solving skills, strategic thinking, and teamwork.
In addition to my passion for programming and gaming, I am also good at fixing common problems in Windows. I enjoy troubleshooting and finding solutions to technical issues, and I'm always willing to lend a helping hand to those who need it.
I am also a Christian, and I believe that my faith is an important part of my life. Christianity teaches me to love and respect others, and to be a kind and compassionate person. It also gives me hope and strength in difficult times.
I enjoy taking photos and videos, especially nature photos and photos and videos from the sky. I like high quality images and videos, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my photography and videography skills.
I have a lot of friends, and I am grateful for the support and friendship they provide.
I also like hearing Christian praise songs, such as this music (https://youtu.be/4g_CHodO-Gw?si=6qyQawUgjTfPlNkA)
I also like to listen to English songs, and I collect good Engglish songs as well. My best songs playlist (if you want to check it out): click here
Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my passions!

So, I want you to make an About Me website.
The website must be colorful, have attractive fonts, eye-catching colors, and LOTS of animations. It should also be interactive.

For the praise song that I like, please create an embedded video player with its own controls (not from YouTube).

My profile photo for the About Me section is:

The main point is: the website must look good-looking, impressive, and engaging, so people will respect and enjoy viewing it. It should have plenty of elements, animations, and interactivity.

Also, make sure the main file is named main.html so I can host it on Cloudflare.
So please use HTML, CSS, and JS.
